# Welcome to the Read me of my jupyter on Docker
This repository has been created in the frame of my intership at ANAGEO. Progressively, I will add more Python projects linked to the goal of my intership.

Chunckage_nairobi file is a "temporary" one to make some tests with gdal_translate. It should disappear in few days.

Slumage file is a jupyter note book file that divide a raster image into a grid. Some code improvement must be done by removing "superflu" code and it will be converted into a function.
